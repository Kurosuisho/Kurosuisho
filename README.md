# Hey there, welcome to my profile ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently taking part in a bootcamp to become a software engineer. My primary toolkit includes **Python** for scripting and backend development, along with **HTML** and **CSS** for crafting clean and responsive web designs. Whether it's automating tasks or building websites, I'm always excited to take on new challenges and improve my skills.

I'm constantly learning, exploring new technologies, and refining my craft. Whether you're here to collaborate, explore my projects, or just have a look around, feel free to connect!
